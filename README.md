## Thoughts

I want to give a huge shout-out to Mark Zuckerberg for creating Facebook. He did this in college, and after trying to build a social app myself, I have a whole new level of respect. It was much harder than I expected. Even planning the structure was challenging to grasp, not just because of the time crunch but because making everything make sense end-to-end is genuinely complex.
